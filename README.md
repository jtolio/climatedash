# climatedash

See https://www.jtolio.com/2022/07/anthropocene-calamity-part-8-climate-models-101/ for an intro to what this is about.

* data.tsv is the climate data https://climatedash.fly.dev serves
* the code for generating data.tsv is in the data-gen folder
* index.py is the UI
* uel.py is what I wanted https://github.com/google/cel-spec to be, but it wasn't, so I wrote it myself
